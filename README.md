# ADI Infrastructure

Hi! This repository contains documentation for ADI's website infrastructure.

If you're new, you probably want to start with our [Getting
Started](guides/getting-started.md) tutorial before browing our other
[guides](guides/).

For common tasks and/or problems, take a look at our runbooks:
- [How to give people SSH access to our server](runbooks/sshkeys.md)
- [What to do if we're out of disk space](runbooks/disk-space.md)
- [How do I deploy a new static website](runbooks/new-static-website.md)
